                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planet Cybertron was consumed by a civil war between the two Transformer
                    factions, the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron, for the AllSpark, a
                    cube-like object that is the source of all Cybertronian life. The Autobots want to find the AllSpark
                    so they can use it to rebuild Cybertron and end the war, while the Decepticons want to use it to
                    defeat the Autobots and conquer the universe.
                    Megatron found the AllSpark on Earth, but crash-landed
                    in the Arctic Circle and was frozen in the ice. Captain Archibald Witwicky and his crew of explorers
                    stumbled upon Megatron in 1897. Captain Witwicky accidentally activates Megatron's navigational
                    system, causing his eyeglasses to be imprinted with the coordinates of the AllSpark's location.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sector 7, a secret United States government organization, discovers the AllSpark
                    in the Colorado
                    River and builds the Hoover Dam around it to mask its energy emissions. The still-frozen Megatron is
                    moved into this facility and is reverse engineered to advance human technology.Frenzy, disguised as
                    a mobile phone, secretly accompanies the group to the Hoover
                    Dam and releases Megatron.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locating the AllSpark, Frenzy sends an alert to the other Decepticons. Sam
                    convinces the
                    Sector 7 agents to release Bumblebee so that he can get the AllSpark to Optimus Prime. Frenzy's
                    virus has shut down government communications, but a pair of hackers manage to establish a signal to
                    the Air Force. The Autobot-human convoy goes to nearby Mission City, Nevada to obtain a radio that
                    will guide the Air Force's defense and secure a rendezvous point as a safe destination for the
                    AllSpark.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Decepticons attack and Brawl, Bonecrusher, Frenzy, Jazz, Devastator, and
                    Blackout are
                    all killed during the ensuing battle, but Sam manages to ram the AllSpark into Megatron's chest,
                    killing Megatron and destroying the AllSpark. Optimus takes a fragment of the AllSpark from
                    Megatron's corpse but realizes that with its destruction, their homeworld Cybertron cannot be
                    restored. <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US government decommissions Sector 7 and dumps the corpses of the defeated
                    Decepticons
                    into the Laurentian Abyss. Sam and Mikaela begin a relationship, and Optimus sends a signal to other
                    surviving Autobots directing them to Earth.

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 17,000 B.C., the Primes (the original Autobots) get their energy from sun
                    harvesters, machines
                    that consume stars to harness their energy. The Primes vowed never to deplete a star that sustains
                    life. One Prime attempted to violate this rule by building a sun harvester on Earth, for which he
                    was imprisoned by the other six Primes, becoming "the Fallen", the original Decepticon.

                    In 2009, two years after the battle of Mission City,[a] the Autobots and the humans have formed NEST
                    (Non-biological Extraterrestrial Species Treaty), a classified international joint task force to
                    eliminate the remaining Decepticons. Two of them, Sideways and Demolishor, are defeated in Shanghai,
                    but the latter declares "the Fallen shall rise again." before being killed. Meanwhile, the
                    Decepticon Soundwave hacks a military satellite. The Decepticons steal the last known piece of the
                    AllSpark shard from a U.S Navy base in Diego Garcia and use it to resurrect Megatron while killing
                    one of their own to provide parts for his body. The Fallen sends Megatron and his second-in-command,
                    Starscream, to capture Sam Witwicky alive and kill Optimus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, NEST forces and the Autobots land near the Giza pyramid complex and are
                    attacked by the
                    Decepticons. The Constructicons combine to form Devastator, who reveals the sun harvester hidden
                    inside a pyramid before he is destroyed. A majority of the Decepticons are annihilated, mostly with
                    multiple airstrikes from the Navy and the U.S Air Force, but Megatron badly injures Sam. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near death,
                    the Primes speak to Sam, saying that the Matrix must be earned, not found, and that he has the right
                    to bear it by fighting for Optimus. They revive Sam and grant him the Matrix, which he uses to
                    restore Optimus. The Fallen steals the Matrix from a weakened Optimus and uses it to activate the
                    sun harvester. After a wounded Jetfire sacrifices himself to allow his parts to be used for
                    additional power and flight, Optimus destroys the harvester and kills the Fallen. Heavily damaged
                    and distraught by his master's death, Megatron retreats with Starscream. The Autobots and their
                    allies then return to the United States, and Sam and Leo return to college.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1961, the Ark, a Cybertronian spacecraft carrying an invention capable of
                    ending the war between
                    Autobots and Decepticons, crash lands on the dark side of Earth's Moon and is detected by NASA.
                    President John F. Kennedy authorizes a mission to put a man on the Moon as a cover for investigating
                    the spacecraft. In 1969, the crew of Apollo 11 lands on the Moon and secretly inspect the Ark before
                    heading home. Their orders are to keep the details of this mission secret.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present day, two years after Egypt,[N 1] the Autobots assist humanity in
                    preventing major
                    conflicts. During a mission to the site of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine to
                    investigate suspected alien technology, the Autobots are attacked by Decepticon scientist Shockwave
                    and his giant worm Driller. After the two escape, Optimus Prime discovers that the technology is a
                    fuel cell from the Ark, thought to have been lost after escaping Cybertron. The Autobots travel to
                    the Moon and discover Sentinel Prime, the Autobots' leader before Optimus, in a comatose state along
                    with five Pillars he created as a means of establishing a "Space Bridge", a wormhole able to
                    teleport matter between two points. On Earth, Optimus uses the energy of the Matrix of Leadership to
                    revive Sentinel.
                </p>
                <p>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky lives with his new girlfriend, Carly Spencer but is unable
                    to work with the
                    Autobots. At his new job, co-worker Jerry Wang gives him information about the Ark, before being
                    assassinated by the Decepticon Laserbeak. It turns out that the Decepticons are murdering people
                    connected to the American and Soviet space missions to the Ark. Sam contacts Seymour Simmons, and
                    they locate two surviving cosmonauts, who reveal photos of hundreds of Pillars being stockpiled on
                    the Moon.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam fights Dylan and knocks him into the Pillar, electrocuting and killing him.
                    Bumblebee and
                    Ratchet destroy the Control Pillar, permanently disabling the Bridge and causing the partially
                    transported Cybertron to implode. Meanwhile, Carly convinces Megatron that he will be replaced by
                    Sentinel as the leader of the Decepticons. While fighting, Sentinel is about to kill Optimus but is
                    incapacitated by Megatron, who is determined to regain his leadership. Megatron then falsely offers
                    a truce, but Optimus turns him down and decapitates him. Sentinel tries to explain his actions to
                    Optimus but is executed by him for betraying his own teachings. Carly and Sam are reunited, and the
                    Autobots remain on Earth as their permanent home.
