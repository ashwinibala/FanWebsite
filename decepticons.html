                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Megatron is a fictional character and the main antagonist of the Transformers
                        media franchise produced by American toy company Hasbro and Japanese toy company Takara Tomy.
                        Megatron is the cruel and tyrannical leader of the Decepticons, a faction of sentient,
                        war-mongering
                        robotic lifeforms that seeks to conquer their home planet of Cybertron and the rest of the known
                        universe. He serves as the archenemy of Optimus Prime, the leader of the rival Autobot faction.
                        As
                        with all Cybertronians, Megatron has the ability to transform between his robot form and various
                        vehicles or weapons. His alternate modes have ranged from a Walther P38 handgun, a particle-beam
                        weapon, a telescopic laser cannon, and a Cybertronian jet, depending on which continuity he is
                        depicted in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Megatron's most consistent origin portrays him as having risen up from being
                        an
                        oppressed worker to a gladiatorial champion who took the legendary name of one of the original
                        Thirteen Primes—Megatronus—as his own. He shortened his name when he became a political
                        revolutionary who attempted to reform Cybertron's corrupt governing body and called for an end
                        to
                        its decrepit caste system. As the mentor of the young Orion Pax, Megatron preached that freedom
                        of
                        self-determination was the right of all sentient beings. When Megatron grew corrupted by his
                        power,
                        Orion would utilize his teachings against him as Optimus Prime. In most incarnations, Megatron
                        would
                        eventually meet his demise at Optimus' hands, only to later be resurrected as Galvatron.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shockwave was left to watch Cybertron by Megatron long ago, but he would
                        eventually follow the call of the AllSpark to Earth. Deadly efficient with a cold devotion to
                        logic,
                        Shockwave is a killing machine like few others and one of the very few who could rival Megatron.
                        This has made him quite popular amongst the Decepticons; some respect him enough to willingly
                        work
                        with him while others idolize him to the point of avenging his death. Nevertheless, Shockwave is
                        ready and willing to destroy whichever Autobots dare stand in his way with his arm-mounted
                        AstroMag
                        Cannon.

                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shockwave and his pet Driller attacked the Autobots when they were summoned to
                        Chernobyl by the Decepticon agent Alexi Voskhod. This was done as an act of misdirection to
                        ensure
                        that the Autobots did not realize that the Decepticons actually wanted them to find the fuel
                        cell
                        from the Ark located within the facility. After Optimus retrieved the fuel cell from the
                        Driller,
                        Shockwave emerged from it to reveal himself to Optimus, and the pair quickly retreated
                        underground,
                        leaving Optimus very disturbed to see Shockwave on Earth.
