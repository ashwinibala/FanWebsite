                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optimus Prime, known in Japan as Convoy, is a fictional character in the
                        Transformers
                        franchise. The Transformers characters were developed for an American market after Hasbro
                        representatives visited the 1983 Tokyo Toy Show. The characters were modified and the coloring
                        was
                        changed; notably, Optimus Prime was colored red, white, and blue. <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the history of the Transformers franchise, Optimus Prime has been
                        portrayed
                        by a variety of
                        actors,
                        such as Peter Cullen, Garry Chalk, Neil Kaplan, David Kaye and Jake Tillman.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Transformers mythology, Optimus Prime is a Cybertronian, an
                        extraterrestrial species of
                        sentient
                        self-configuring modular robotic lifeforms (e.g.: cars and other objects), a synergistic blend
                        of
                        biological evolution and technological engineering.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In almost every version of the mythos, Optimus
                        is
                        the leader of the Autobots, a faction of Transformers who are rivals of the Decepticons, another
                        faction. He is defined by his strong moral character and is almost always portrayed as the
                        primary
                        hero
                        of the story, opposing the Decepticon leader Megatron.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bumblebee is a fictional robot character appearing in the many continuities in
                        the
                        Transformers franchise. The character is a member of the Autobots, a group of sentient,
                        self-configuring, modular extraterrestrial robotic lifeforms. Bumblebee appears as one of the
                        main
                        Autobot characters in the live-action Transformers film series and the protagonist of his own
                        film
                        Bumblebee. He retains some elements from his Generation 1 design, such as the horn-like pieces
                        in
                        his head, which are articulated in the films. Bumblebee was given a different alternate mode
                        from
                        his original G1 incarnation; instead of a Volkswagen Beetle, he transforms into a rally yellow
                        Chevrolet Camaro (the model year of which is upgraded in the first film). Due to a battle
                        injury, he
                        is rendered effectively mute, and communicates through use of selected playback of radio and
                        television signals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the original line of toys and in the animated series, Bumblebee is a small
                        yellow Volkswagen
                        Beetle. In the live action movies, he has appeared as vehicles inspired by the Chevrolet
                        American
                        muscle cars - with the live-action film versions being a yellow Camaro with black racing
                        stripes.
                        The original vehicle-mode design was based on a classic European Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle. The
                        character is named after the bumblebee, a black-and-yellow striped insect which inspired his
                        paint
                        scheme. Bumblebee is a fan-favorite character and he appears in most of the series and later
                        becomes
                        the main protagonist in Transformers: Robots in Disguise, Bumblebee, and Transformers:
                        Cyberverse.
                        Bumblebee has also taken the form of a 1977 second generation Camaro, later appearing as fifth
                        generation Camaro in the 2018 film, Bumblebee.
